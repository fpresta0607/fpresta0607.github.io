    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Stoma and Peristomal Skin Complication Imaging Tool</h3>
          <p>At Hollister Incorporated, I had the privilege of spearheading the development of a ground-breaking tool that leverages the latest advancements in computer vision and machine learning. Our tool standardizes the measurement and segmentation of stoma and peristomal skin complications by utilizing the power of smartphone camera images.

            With my expertise, I oversaw the tool's ability to perform batch analysis of crucial features, presenting clear and concise histogram statistics, all while ensuring the transparency of the algorithm's performance. The results were truly impactful and were presented to internal decision makers at Hollister Inc., showcasing the tool's potential for product customization and telehealth applications.
            
            This project not only allowed me to demonstrate my technical prowess, but also my ability to communicate complex concepts in a way that resonates with a non-technical audience. The success of this project has led to a greater understanding of imaging technology within the company and has resulted in an IP of my algorithm being filed for protection. I am proud to have made a lasting impact on the future of technology at Hollister Incorporated.</p>
          <h3>Development of a Customized Epileptic Monitoring System</h3>
          <p>I am proud to be part of a cutting-edge collaboration with the Neurosurgery department at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). Our goal is to design and implement a custom EEG recording system that will revolutionize the invasive monitoring of epileptic patients. Our team is dedicated to meeting the specific needs of both the patients and the department, ensuring mechanical adaptability, pristine signal processing, and dependable memory storage.

            Under the leadership of clinical researcher, Dr. Hernan Rey, we are conducting innovative experiments involving the implantation of microelectrodes into patients with epilepsy. These patients undergo a series of stimulation tests over several days, allowing us to acquire valuable data 24/7.
            
            As a key member of this project, I am developing a custom GUI to monitor critical device information, as well as optimizing an ETL pipeline to streamline the data acquisition process. With the successful implementation of these innovative solutions, we can ensure the reliability and efficiency of our data collection efforts, further propelling this groundbreaking research forward</p>
        <h3>Evaluation and Optimization of a Natural Language Processing Model</h3>
          <p>After being introduced to Hollister Incorporated's Futurism initiative, I was tasked with evaluating the effectiveness of an existing natural language processing model, BERT. I meticulously documented the accuracy, limitations, and requirements for advanced techniques such as topic modeling and clue estimation.

            My findings were presented to the leaders of the initiative, where I successfully communicated the importance of improvement, implementation, and maintenance of the machine. I also outlined the necessary skill set and expertise required for further development, ensuring that the company is fully equipped to tackle the exciting challenges of natural language processing and deep learning.
            
            My work not only demonstrated my technical aptitude and attention to detail, but also my ability to communicate complex ideas and provide actionable insights to decision-makers.</p>
