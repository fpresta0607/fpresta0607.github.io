    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Project 1: Ostomy & PSC Measurement Tool</h3>
        <p>Our smartphone camera's have become so advanced that they can detect things humans cannot see with their own eye. This tool can detect irritation and its degree of severity using a novel algorithm. To learn more about the technique see this IP! </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Project 2: EEG 24/7 Acquistion System</h3>
        <p>Working alongside the Nuerosurgey department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, my goal is to develop a functional setup to perform clinical (epilepsy) and cognitive (memory/perception) research by recording 24/7 from different scales in the human brain. This project is currently ongoing with its final delieverable due by May 1st.</p>
