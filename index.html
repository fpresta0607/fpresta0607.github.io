    <h1>Francesco Presta</h1>
    <h2>Biomedical Engineer</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my professional profile. I am a recent graduate of Marquette University, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a concentration in Biocomputing and a minor in Business Administration. I have experience in machine learning, computer vision, and data analysis, as well as a strong background in image processing and natural language processing.

        <h3>Project 1: Ostomy & PSC Measurement Tool</h3>
        <p>Our smartphone camera's have become so advanced that they can detect things humans cannot see with their own eye. This tool can detect irritation and its degree of severity using a novel algorithm. To learn more about the technique see this IP! </p>

        <h3>Project 2: EEG 24/7 Acquistion System</h3>
        <p>Working alongside the Nuerosurgey department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, my goal is to develop a functional setup to perform clinical (epilepsy) and cognitive (memory/perception) research by recording 24/7 from different scales in the human brain. This project is currently ongoing with its final delieverable due by May 1st.</p>
